Text::Tabs performs the same job that the unix expand(1) and unexpand(1)
commands do: adding or removing tabs from a document.

Text::Wrap will reformat lines into paragraphs.  All it does is break
up long lines, it will not join short lines together.

Install them with:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install
