Test improvements from Dave Mitchel sent back in 2005...

Added code to increase $columns if it's not big enough to accommodate
the subsequent tab.

Minor documentation fixes from David Landgren <david at landgren.net>.

Use warnings::warnif instead of just warn for columns < 2.  Appled per
request of Rafael Garcia-Suarez <rgarciasuarez at gmail.com>.

Text::Tabs can handle newlines now so the BUGS section has been removed
per request from Aristotle Pagaltzis.

2006.0711 Tue 11 Jul 2006
Further bomb-proofing to pass more tests: Dan Jacobson <jidanni at 
jidanni dot org> found another way to generate a "this shouldn't happen".

2006.0705 Thu 06 Jul 2006
Made documentation and code changes to address perlbug:
https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=30229

Added in changes from the distributed-with-perl version.  This took 
care of perlbug: https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=34902
It also took care of suggestion from Matthijs Bomhoff <matthijs
at bomhoff dot nl>.

Made documentation changes (added EXAMPLES) as per a suggestion
from Gabor Blasko <gblasko at cs dot columbia dot edu>

belg4mit at MIT dot EDU reported that $columns==1 die'd.  No longer.

Added tests for each bug report.

2005.0824 Wed 24 Aug 2005
Added $separator2 and tests for $separator and $separator2

Aristotle Pagaltzis <pagaltzis at gmx.de> contributed a new version of
expand() that is faster.

Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi at cc.hut.fi> sent in perl change #17917 which
fixed a bug in wrap.

Matthew Durante <matthew_durante at hotmail.com> and 
Don Buchholz <don at truedisk.com> sent in a doc patches.

2001.0929 Sun 30 Sep 2001
Philip Newton <Philip.Newton at gmx.net> sent in a clean patch that
added support for defining words differently; that prevents 
Text::Wrap from untainting strings; and that fixes a documentation
bug.

So that fill.t can be used in the version included in the perl
distribution, fill.t no longer uses File::Slurp.

Both Sweth Chandramouli <svc at sweth.net> and Drew Degentesh 
<ddegentesh at daed.com> both objected to the automatic unexpand
that Text::Wrap does on its results.  Drew sent a patch which
has been integrated.

Way back in '97, Joel Earl <jrearl at VNET.IBM.COM> asked that
it be possible to use a line separator other than \n when
adding new lines.  There is now support for that.

2001.0131 Wed 01 Feb 2001
Bugfix by Michael G Schwern <schwern at pobox.com>: don't add extra
whitespace when working one an array of input (as opposed to a 
single string).

Performance rewrite: use m/\G/ rather than s///.

You can now specify that words that are too long to wrap can simply
overflow the line.  Feature requested by James Hoagland 
<hoagland at SiliconDefense.com> and by John Porter <jdporter at min.net>.

Documentation changes from Rich Bowen <Rich at cre8tivegroup.com>.

98.112902 Sun 29 Nov 1998
Combined Fill.pm into Wrap.pm.  It appears there are versions of
Wrap.pm with fill in them.

98.112801 Sat 28 Nov 1998
Over the last couple of years, many people sent in various
rewrites of Text::Wrap.  I should have done something about
updating it long ago.  If someone wants to take it over from
me, discuss it in perl-porters.  I'll be happy to hand it
over.

Anyway, I have a bunch of people to thank.  I didn't
use what any of them sent in, but I did take ideas from
all of them.  Many sent in complete new implamentations.

	Ivan Brawley <ibrawley at awadi.com.au> 

	Jacqui Caren <Jacqui.Caren at ig.co.uk>

	Jeff Kowalski <jeff.kowalski at autodesk.com>

	Allen Smith <easmith at beatrice.rutgers.edu>

	Sullivan N. Beck <sbeck at cise.ufl.edu>

The end result is a very slight change in the API.  There
is now an additional package variable: $Text::Wrap::huge.
When $huge is set to 'die' then long words will cause 
wrap() to die.  When it is set to 'wrap', long words will
be wrapped.  The default is 'wrap'.

<shout>LONG WORDS WILL NOW BE WRAPPED BY DEFAULT</shout>.  
This is a change in behavior.

At the bottom of Text::Wrap, there was a function (fill())
sitting there unpublished.  There was a note that Tim Pierce
had a faster version, but a search on CPAN failed to turn it
up.  Text::Fill is now available.
